# customers-analysis

The code starts by loading and preprocessing a dataset from a CSV file, handling missing values, data types, and feature engineering. It then performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) using histograms, heatmaps, and correlation plots to understand the distribution of variables and relationships between them. Finally, it applies dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and clustering algorithms like K-Means to identify patterns and group similar observations in the dataset, saving the trained model using Pickle for future use.
